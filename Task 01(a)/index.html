            The natural world is a source of immense beauty and joy, providing us with a healthy environment in which to live.
            It offers diverse flowers, birds, animals, plants, sky, land, rivers, seas, forests, air, mountains, valleys, and hills. 
            This wondrous creation is the work of God, and it sustains our well-being.
